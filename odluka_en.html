                    SFT21 BUSINESS CONCEPT<br>
                </p>
                <h2>Greetings</h2>
                <p>First and foremost, a sincere and heartfelt greeting to everyone.</p>
                <p>Here we are, after almost three full years since the temporary suspension of our business operations, returning with the hope of continuing where we were forced to stop, through no fault of our own.</p>
                <p>It is very important to recall that in 2018, we registered the company InFace Invest Group LTD, with which we launched our business concept in 2019 honorably, honestly, and transparently, with the best intentions of creating a unique online community through a franchise business model. The plan was for the development of the company and the entire community, which includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>development of software and applications,</li>
                    <li>launching the franchise business model called the SFT21 Business Concept,</li>
                    <li>operational, administrative, and other ongoing development costs,</li>
                    <li>and marketing and infrastructure needs related to the SFT21 project,</li>
                </ul>
                <p>...to be financed from the earnings generated from the sale of franchises to our members and their upgrades, as well as from investors, both large and small.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, due to a series of unfavorable circumstances, we were forced, due to the inability to pay for the maintenance, development, and operational costs of the company, to gradually cancel the initiated development until the recent removal of all our portal pages from the internet.</p>
                <p>The poor quality of work by a portion of our users, the subsequent and prolonged Covid crisis, and most significantly, the public dissemination of lies, slander, and insults by three former usersâ€”with whom we terminated our business relationship due to serious violations of business rules and against whom criminal charges have been filedâ€”are the real reasons for the slowdown in development and this temporary suspension of business.</p>
                <p>We have informed our members in detail about these reasons by recording about thirty videos with evidence, arguments, and facts, which we published on the company's YouTube channel, so we have said mostly everything on that matter.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, these videos were viewed on average 1,500 times, rarely watched to the end, some videos were viewed less than 1,000 times, a small number more than 2,000 times, and none more than 3,000 times.</p>
                <p>When we consider that more than 24,000 users were registered with the company, it is evident that a large majority of users are not aware of the real and true reasons that led to this temporary business suspension.</p>
                <p>However, this is precisely an indicator of the wrong and incorrect work of the vast majority of our members, as well as clear proof of the members' lack of information regarding both the mentioned evidence and the general development of the company and the entire community.</p>
                <p>For how else can one explain the fact that out of 24,000 users, nearly 14,000 of them <strong>NEVER</strong> accessed the social network upon its launch?!</p>
                <p>How can one explain the fact that out of 24,000 users, we have only 2,800 subscribers on our YouTube channel, which should be one of the main communication and information channels...</p>
                <p>Where are the other 21,200 users? Who are these people? Who registered them? How did they stay informed about news, work obligations, and business operations in general?</p>
                <p>In short, it is clear to many today that the company temporarily ceased operations, not due to its own fault, but because of the aforementioned problems which we could not influence and, unfortunately, could not foresee at the start.</p>
                <p>When we noticed the problem, we tried to react, but with a lack of funds, we could not do much, as certain changes in the business system simply require money.</p>
                <p>By taking the portal pages offline due to the inability to cover ongoing costs, the company did not cease its operations, nor did we abandon the vision of creating an online community, which we have transparently promoted from the very beginning.</p>
                <p>Looking back, we can now say that perhaps we made a mistake in choosing the method of financing the company's development, as we naively believed that with the help of our members, we would reach at least 50,000 users without major problems, a number that would have provided us with enough funds to complete the necessary software and applications essential for the further development of the business concept and the community we began to create.</p>
                <p>As everyone knows, due to the mentioned problems, we did not succeed in this.</p>
                <p>However, although some members thought this was the definitive end of our business, we never for a moment gave up on our idea and the business we started. Instead, we did everything in our power to continue our operations.</p>
                <p>First of all, it is important to note that we launched our business with a 90-day money-back guarantee, which we honored by ensuring that <strong>EVERY</strong> user who submitted a refund request within the deadline received their money back. It was this money-back guarantee that led the company to its biggest problem, because with the appearance of public false accusations, slander, and insults against the company and its owners, an increasing number of members decided to request a refund. In a situation where we needed more and more money for software development and other costs, we were forced to return money to honor the given guarantee, which consequently slowed down the entire development and ultimately led to the temporary suspension of business.</p>
                <p>Likewise, it has been clearly and unequivocally stated that the money paid for "full franchises" and for larger investments is not under a money-back guarantee, as that money was immediately distributed, used to pay developers' invoices, or to cover other ongoing development costs.</p>
                <p>Accordingly... in line with the franchise agreement you signed, SFT21 company (ex InFace Invest Group LTD) is <strong>NOT OBLIGATED TO RETURN THE MONEY YOU PAID FOR A STARTER PACKAGE OR A LARGER INVESTMENT</strong>. However, as we do not want anyone to feel they have been wronged by our company, your investment will be returned to you!</p>
                <p>Given the fact that users' money was spent on the company's development, the money intended for refunds to users who decide to discontinue their business simply <strong>DOES NOT EXIST</strong> at this moment.</p>
                <p>The solution to the problem, both for members who are discontinuing their business and for members who wish to continue, lies only in securing the necessary funds for certain changes in the SFT21 software, as well as for the completion of the software and applications for the social network and webshop, which is ultimately a prerequisite for continuing operations.</p>
                <p>In this regard, we have decided to present a new, upgraded, and in some segments, modified business concept, after which we will launch a phase of selling Initial Packages.</p>
                <p>The money raised from the sale of these packages will be stored in the company's account and used primarily for the upgrade and completion of the initiated software and applications. The company's priority is to raise funds that will ensure the start of an uninterrupted continuation of business, after which refunds will be issued to users who withdraw and submit a refund request.</p>
                <p>After the fundraising period ends and before the first positions in the SF algorithm are filled, the company will timely notify all users from the old system to make a decision about discontinuing their business and requesting a refund.</p>
                <p><strong>REFUNDS WILL BE PROCESSED TRANSPARENTLY ACCORDING TO THE RULES, WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT MONEY IS RETURNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANY'S ABILITIES, BASED ON THE DATE OF PAYMENT FOR THE STARTER PACKAGE OR INVESTMENT.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED, THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING ITS OPERATIONS AND COMMITS TO REFUNDING ALL WHO SUBMIT A REQUEST - WHEN IT IS ABLE TO DO SO.</strong></p>
                <p>Users against whom criminal charges have been filed, as well as those users who have withdrawn earnings from the old system that are greater than or equal to their paid starter package or investment, are not entitled to a refund.</p>
                <p>When submitting a refund request, it will be necessary to attach a photo of a valid personal identification document with which you completed the KYC identity verification, or a photo of a new document if your old one has expired.</p>
                <p>The money will then be returned to you via the payment processor you used for the payment, or possibly by other means, about which you will be timely informed.</p>
                <p>Given that a certain period of time will pass before the company is able to start issuing refunds, our most sincere advice is not to discard your membership in our community lightly. We suggest you follow our development and events within the company during this period and study all the benefits of the new SFT21 business concept, so that you can make your final decision about continuing or discontinuing your business based on the latest information.</p>
                <p>Because one fact is irrefutable and no one has tried to deny it to this day... and that is the fact that we have started creating a community where users will have the opportunity to launch their own internet business through our portal's pages, where they will develop their own social network and webshop, with the possibility of earning in multiple ways, along with many other benefits.</p>
                <p>Regardless of all the problems, obstacles, and challenges that have led to the current situation, we are simply moving forward. Because we know... as do many of our loyal members, that we have started creating a project with unlimited potential for the benefit of our members, and that nothing will stop us.</p>
                <p>We must admit that the public false accusations, slander, and insults have temporarily stopped us, causing us enormous damage. But despite everything, knowing that we are not at fault and knowing that we hold a more than valuable business project in our hands, we are rising from the ashes like a phoenix...</p>
                <p>They stopped us with <strong>LIES</strong> and threw us to the bottom... and they temporarily succeeded.... But despite everything, they did not win. We are rising again and continuing where we left off, because the <strong>TRUTH</strong> is on our side.</p>
                <p>We believe that a large number of our old members will join us on this path, as well as many who will just be hearing about our community. We are aware of the fact that among you, the members from the old system, there are those who have lost trust and have no intention of continuing the business, but we are also aware that there are those among you who know the real reasons for the problems we found ourselves in and who have never lost that trust. Moreover, we know that there are many among you who have realized the value, quality, and opportunities that our business concept brings and who will gladly continue doing business.</p>
                <p>Ahead of us is a period in which we will give everything in our power to secure the funds necessary to complete the mentioned software and applications, to pay off all those who will withdraw and settle our debts, and ultimately to continue our business by working on creating a community for the benefit and interest of our loyal members.</p>
                <p>We know our set path... truth is our fundamental value, while our goals are simply a better and higher quality of life for all our members. We are aware of the quality and social value of our business concept, but to show and prove its true power, we need your help and trust on this journey.</p>
