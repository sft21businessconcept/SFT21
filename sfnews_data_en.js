We are connected with Stripe, our main payment processor, and have secured banking partners – Thread Bank, Relay Financial, and Wise Bank.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-fluorescent-green pt-4">Why is this important?</h3>
            <p>In the old system, as a company registered in Seychelles, although legally compliant with all international standards and with the highest form of transparency, we had a constant problem with banks that simply do not like doing business with companies registered in such remote destinations.</p>
            <p>However, that is now a different story... this time regarding that issue, we have the strongest and highest quality “engine“ that will drive our vision. We are now fully operational and ready to provide You with world-class service and quality, without compromise. Whether you are a user, partner, or team member, you can be sure that you are doing business with a company built on solid, transparent, and most importantly, globally recognized foundations.</p>
            <p>This is just the beginning of our journey. With this infrastructure, boundaries no longer exist. We are ready to grow, innovate, and together with You build the future of a new and different online community with the most powerful, simplest, and safest SFT21 Business Concept.</p>
            <p>A community like ours does not yet exist today. We are pioneers in this... our vision is to connect social networking, webshop, online and direct sales, network marketing, franchise business, and in the near future many other projects into one whole, while most importantly, offering You, our loyal members and business partners, to participate in the development of our story and as such participate in the distribution of profits that such a community can generate.</p>
            <p>Along with all that, our valuable social mission is primarily to help and support small and medium domestic producers and traders, building micro-communities at the local and regional level, with an emphasis on microeconomics with a humanitarian aspect of which we are extremely proud. Our vision and mission are to enable all our loyal members a way to synergistically and together fight for a better and higher quality life for our children, our elderly population, as well as all of You who see yourselves in such a community.</p>
            <p>Ahead of us is a road where challenges await us, occasional obstacles, obligations, and a lot of work tasks that we have yet to complete, but with Your help and support, nothing terrible or special that we could not solve and overcome together. We move forward, bravely and relaxed, above all honorably, honestly, and with the best intentions and with the highest form of transparency.</p>
            <p>We are happy with the fact that despite everything, there are more and more of You... You who have not lost trust in us and our vision, and we are convinced that our number will increase every day as we grow and finish the projects we have set for ourselves.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your incredible support. Thank you to everyone who helped us in the past few months as well as all of You who will join us. Due to the situation we are in, unfortunately, we are not able to organize a celebration of this, for us and loyal members, great moment, but that does not prevent You from joining us in celebrating this big step forward, at least symbolically online via the internet!</p>

            <p>We want to be completely transparent: the possibility of purchasing License Packages directly from the Company is a **one-time and time-limited opportunity** exclusively related to this development phase. After the official launch of the SFT21 platform, SFnet, and SFshop, the Company will permanently suspend the sale of License Packages, and the number of licenses granting the right to passive participation in bonuses will be final.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">Given that a License can have multiple user accounts, and since having three accounts is sufficient for the maximum possible earning, the owner can sell all or surplus accounts on the open market, thus profiting additionally.</p>

                <li><strong class="text-white">Community Growth:</strong> Every new user on SFnet increases the value of the entire ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">SFshop Expansion:</strong> New partners and products, with an increasing number of loyal consumers, make the ecosystem more attractive.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Company Development:</strong> New functionalities make SFLicense (the key to the ecosystem) more valuable.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Limited Number of Licenses:</strong> A fixed number of licenses in circulation naturally affects the market price due to growing demand.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mt-6">By purchasing an SFLicense, you secure your position and ownership in the SFT21 ecosystem at the very beginning of its creation, and an opportunity for passive bonuses (which will not be possible later under the same conditions). After that, you have complete freedom to decide whether and when to activate the Franchise and start actively building your business. Precisely that flexibility makes the SFT21 model unique.</p>
